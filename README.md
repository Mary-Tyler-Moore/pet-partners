## Motivation: :running: :dash:

A student :mortar_board: of mine asked for help :pray: creating a [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/) project. This student uses Windows 10 :computer: so the screen recordings :movie_camera: will reflect this fact. My preference is to develop on Mac :apple: but I am doing this is as a personal favor for my student. If you would like to see a guide for installing [Quasar CLI](https://quasar.dev/start/quasar-cli) on Mac :apple: please check [here](https://github.com/Mary-Tyler-Moore/venues-production).

<br />

## Project Background:

:heart_eyes_cat: ***Pet Partners*** :smile_cat: is a fictional ***Pet Rental Service*** created by my daughter. She is my #1 UX/UI tester and has extensive experience catching bugs :space_invader: in my cross-platform :floppy_disk: :dash: applications. She is the :star: of my life!

<br />

## What to Expect:

***Lots*** of cute pictures of pets. We are starting off by offering cats :cat2: dogs :dog2: and rabbits :rabbit2: on short-term lease, but we are also open to exotic :dragon: varieties of pets as well. :heart_eyes_cat: ***Pet Partners*** :smile_cat: will house and nurture any type of pet as long as that pet brings their owner joy. ***Our mission*** is to bring joy to everyone through the power of pets. If your pet brings you joy there is an high probability :chart_with_upwards_trend: that your pet will bring someone else joy as well.

Please :pray: make a Pull Request if you would like to add your favorite pet to the list below.

## ***Pet Rental List:***

> - Dogs :dog:
> - Cats :cat:
> - Rabbits :rabbit:
> - Baby Yoda :green_heart:

<br />

## Target Market:

:heart_eyes_cat: ***Pet Partners*** :smile_cat: will aggressively market to anyone having a bad day :sob:. In case of an emergency, our clients can contact us on the hotline :telephone_receiver: listed on our site. In the coming weeks we will be adding a Pet Booking and Reversavation system as well.

The mission of :heart_eyes_cat: ***Pet Partners*** :smile_cat: is to brighten :rainbow: people's day with our loving, and well behaved pets. We at ***Pet Partners*** are committed to offering pet accessibility to those who are sick, depressed or stressed out!
