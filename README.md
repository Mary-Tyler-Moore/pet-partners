## Motivation: :running: :dash:
A student :school_satchel: of mine asked for help :pray: creating a [Quasar](https://quasar.dev/) project. This student uses Windows 10 :computer: so the screen recordings :movie_camera: will reflect this fact.

I prefer to work on Apple :apple: but I am doing this is as a personal favor. If would like to see a guide for installing [Quasar CLI](https://quasar.dev/start/quasar-cli) on Apple :apple: please check [here](https://github.com/Mary-Tyler-Moore/venues-production).

<br />

## Project Background:
**Pet Partners** is a fictional Pet :rabbit: Rental :dog: Service created by my daughter. She is my #1 UX/UI tester and has extensive experience catching bugs :space_invader: in my cross-platform Applications :floppy_disk: :dash: . She is the :star: of my life. 

<br />

## What to Expect:
***Lots*** of cute pictures of pets. We are starting off with cats :cat: dogs :dog: and rabbits :rabbits: but we are open to exotic :dragon: varities of pets as well. ***Pet Partners*** will house and nurture any type of pet as long as that pet brings their owner joy. 

Please :pray: make Pull Request if you want to add your favorite pet to the list below. 

> ***Pet Rental List:***
> * Dogs :dog:
> * Cats :cat:
> * Rabbits :rabbit:
> * Baby Yoda :green_heart:

<br />

## Target Market:
***Pet Partners*** will aggressively market to anyone who is having a bad day :sob:. Customers will be able to reach us on the hotline we will have listed as a banner on the top of our website, but we will also setup a pet booking system with Node.js and Mongo DB Cloud Atlas.

The mission of ***Pet Partners*** is to brighten :rainbow: people's day with our loving, and well behaved pets. We at ***Pet Partners*** are committed to offering pet accessibility to those who are sick, depressed or stressed out!

<br />

## :floppy_disk: :dash: Developer Accessibility Statement:

#### :crystal_ball: I see great success in your future. Believe in yourself and you will achieve anything. 

#### :broken_heart: Anyone can experience burn out when learning a new technology. If you face an error during installation or deployment, don't sweat :sweat: it!

#### :gift_heart: Always remember there are Quasarians worldwide :earth_americas: ready to help you.
